For my Intro to Creative Writing class I wrote two poems to represent how I felt moving abroad to the U.S. and being away from my family.

My mother\'s song (Villanelle)

My mother used to sing the sounds of my home,

A song of resistance fluttered from her lips,

My mother sang the pains of my people\'s holm.

Her voice rose like the lament of the coqui\'s catacomb,

Missing the hidden paradise that was a regular trip,

My mother used to sing the sounds of my home.

The Tambor in her chest churning like seafoam,

Shattering the mainland into broken drips,

My mother sang the pains in my people\'s holm.

Glimpses of her home now turned monochrome,

Like a soprano whose tune traps you within grip,

My mother used to sing the sounds of my home.

Memories scratching against like a broken comb,

Stories of horror and love without censorship,

My mother sang the pains in my people\'s holm.

The song she raised me to break from the dome,

So I would never leave it to be a forgotten clip,

My mother used to sing the sounds of my home,

My mother sang the pains in my people\'s holm.

Free Verse Poem

The music echoed through the room,

Colorful skirts twirled with purpose,

Bodies moved through the stage,

Shapes tangled together as the song quickened.

I clapped my hands with a smile,

His gaze followed me corner to corner,

I tried to make my way to him,

But the bodies kept pushing me to the edge.

I could no longer see him in the crowd,

The song paced down like a lament,

Alone I was left wondering,

\"What could have been?\"

For the first time I had realized,

We were all brief moments,

In each other\'s lives.Â 

The wind blazes against the rocks,

Water slushes against my thigh,

I feel salt glistening around my skin,

The sun reddened my face.

Colorful sound surrounds me as birds chirp to the sky,

I can taste the ocean on my lips,

But it is not enough,

I want to be one with the sea.

I want to flow across the world,

Like a soft stream plucked from a dream,

I want to whisper to the wind my deepest

Desires. And I want the world to wettened them with possibility.

Children playing along the shore,

Laughter following along in waves,

I want to be filled with dreams and wishes,

Just as the sea is with the people.
