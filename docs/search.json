    "text": "I wrote this article while taking Intro to Newswritting in 2021 to showcase the problem of domestic violence on the island and how the pandemic exacerbated the problem.\nShelters Struggle to Stay Afloat During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nBy Nuria Diaz Munoz\nShelters for victims of abuse are struggling to adjust to the new health measures due to the lack of adequate resources from the government against the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic violence cases rise to 83% during the COVID-19 pandemic according to a study published on February of this year by the Coordinadora Paz para la Mujer, Inc in Puerto Rico.\nGov. Pedro Pierluisi declared a state of emergency on Jan. 24, ordering new government programs to educate and prevent domestic violence in response to the number of domestic violence cases increasing by 83% during the pandemic. Officials in charge of various shelters on the island agreed the order is a “step in the right direction” but said lack of government funding to implement the programs remains the biggest challenge. The government has yet to implement executive order, and shelter officials say they feel “abandoned.”\nThe women’s law division within the Puerto Rican government has not responded to media inquiries about the rise in domestic violence during the pandemic. That silence has prompted the Coordinadora Paz para la Mujer Inc, a coalition against domestic violence and sexual assault, to investigate the government’s inaction and the problems shelters are facing.\nNereida Valentin, communications director of the Coordinadora Paz para la Mujer Inc, said the government’s women’s law division had been facing uncertainty since the director resigned in December 2020 abruptly. The organization has been operating throughout the pandemic without any leadership since the end of last year. Valentin said the division didn’t provide shelters with enough money or other resources and lacked a “concrete” plan of action for addressing domestic violence during the pandemic.\n“Many were left uncertain on how to approach the pandemic as they were left with an empty space at the head of the table,” Valentin said. “As the situation worsened many of the current resources the division held were stretched thin due to lack of coordination from the different governmental departments.”\nValentin said the government did not view shelters as essential services during the pandemic, prioritizing health services inhospitals.  She said vaccines and tests are arriving at a minimal quantity due to them being processed from the mainland, which has led the government to focus on vaccinating the population at the highest risk.\n“In the end, the division did their best with the conditions they faced at the time which were not optimal,” Valentin said. “Currently we are working with the division to form a better plan of action to alleviate the needs of the shelters, but as it is still in process, I cannot share the details as of today.”\nGloria Vázquez, shelter executive director of Casa de la Bondad in Humacao, said they struggled to communicate with many victims that took part in the program prior to the pandemic. Shelter employees had to create escape plans from the victim’s homes to the shelter facilities during the first months of the pandemic. \n“We have focused on communicating with the victims via text messages and calls to connect them with the professionals they needed,” Vázquez said. “Sadly, we had some cases where we lost contact with many of the victims as they were locked in with their abusers.”\nVázquez said her shelter was able to shift all its programs onto virtual platforms to continue providing many services to participants. She said the shelter focused its efforts on guaranteeing many victims receive legal services to protect them from their abusers.\n“The different regions where we bring services, which are Humacao and Fajardo, have focused on helping the victims arrive at the facilities and receive immediate attention to request protection orders,” Vázquez said. \nVázquez said that in the past weeks after the governor issued the state of emergency, the shelter received more women into their facilities. They have noticed an increase in the number of women over 50 years old in their ambulatory services program but aren’t sure why.\n“Casa de la Bondad has continued to provide all our services even with the current pandemic crisis,” said Vázquez. “We have focused our efforts on guaranteeing the safety of all the women in our facilities.”\nVázquez said the government has offered shelters financial aid during the crisis, but it has yet to materialize. Like the Hogar Nueva Mujer shelter, she said they have not received any safety gear or COVID-19 tests from the government. They are currently waiting for any update on when employees will be able to be vaccinated.\n“It really worries us as shelter services are essential services, and it’s important to take care of our personnel who have been supporting the victims and their children,” Vazquez said. “We are left to wait.”"

    "text": "For my Intro to Creative Writing class I wrote two poems to represent how I felt moving abroad to the U.S. and being away from my family.\nMy mother’s song (Villanelle)\nMy mother used to sing the sounds of my home,\nA song of resistance fluttered from her lips,\nMy mother sang the pains of my people’s holm.\nHer voice rose like the lament of the coqui’s catacomb,\nMissing the hidden paradise that was a regular trip,\nMy mother used to sing the sounds of my home.\nThe Tambor in her chest churning like seafoam,\nShattering the mainland into broken drips,\nMy mother sang the pains in my people’s holm.\nGlimpses of her home now turned monochrome,\nLike a soprano whose tune traps you within grip,\nMy mother used to sing the sounds of my home.\nMemories scratching against like a broken comb,\nStories of horror and love without censorship,\nMy mother sang the pains in my people’s holm.\nThe song she raised me to break from the dome,\nSo I would never leave it to be a forgotten clip,\nMy mother used to sing the sounds of my home,\nMy mother sang the pains in my people’s holm.\nFree Verse Poem\nThe music echoed through the room,\nColorful skirts twirled with purpose,\nBodies moved through the stage,\nShapes tangled together as the song quickened.\nI clapped my hands with a smile,\nHis gaze followed me corner to corner,\nI tried to make my way to him,\nBut the bodies kept pushing me to the edge.\nI could no longer see him in the crowd,\nThe song paced down like a lament,\nAlone I was left wondering,\n“What could have been?”\nFor the first time I had realized,\nWe were all brief moments,\nIn each other’s lives. \nThe wind blazes against the rocks,\nWater slushes against my thigh,\nI feel salt glistening around my skin,\nThe sun reddened my face.\nColorful sound surrounds me as birds chirp to the sky,\nI can taste the ocean on my lips,\nBut it is not enough,\nI want to be one with the sea.\nI want to flow across the world,\nLike a soft stream plucked from a dream,\nI want to whisper to the wind my deepest\nDesires. And I want the world to wettened them with possibility.\nChildren playing along the shore,\nLaughter following along in waves,\nI want to be filled with dreams and wishes,\nJust as the sea is with the people.\n```"
